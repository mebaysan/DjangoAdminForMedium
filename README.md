# Introduction

I started to prepare this repo to explain how we can customize the Admin app in Django. This repo is dependent a [Medium story series](https://mebaysan.medium.com/).

Each branch divided as a chapter, and each chapter detailly explained in [the Medium series](https://mebaysan.medium.com/). I enjoy while coding and writing. Hopefully, you too.

Kind regards.
